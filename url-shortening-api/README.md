## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Vanilla JS

### What I learned

Despite the fact that this is a small project in its own way, he pointed out to me my gaps in knowledge of how some properties work in CSS. I also studied Flexbox and Grid better, and now the following projects will have a more correct structure. I hope so.

### Continued development

I want to improve my knowledge of CSS so that in the future the layout of such simple sites takes much less time. Since the functional part related to JS took me about a quarter of the time.
